## 4. Sending Messages to the Webhook

### Using Python

```python
import requests

WEBHOOK_URL = "YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL"

data = {
    "content": "Hello from Discord Webhook!"
}

response = requests.post(WEBHOOK_URL, json=data)

if response.status_code == 204:
    print("Message sent successfully!")
else:
    print(f"Failed to send message: {response.status_code}")
```

---

### Using cURL

```bash
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -X POST \
     -d '{"content": "Hello from Discord Webhook via cURL!"}' \
     YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL
```

---

## 5. Security Tips

* **Do not share your Webhook URL** publicly.
* If your Webhook URL is exposed, delete and recreate it immediately.
* Use environment variables or a `.env` file to store your Webhook URL.

---

## 6. Optional: Sending Messages Automatically (Python Example)

```python
import requests
import time

WEBHOOK_URL = "YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL"

while True:
    data = {"content": "This is an automated message!"}
    requests.post(WEBHOOK_URL, json=data)
    time.sleep(10)  # send every 10 seconds
```
